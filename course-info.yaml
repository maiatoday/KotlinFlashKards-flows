title: KotlinFlashKards - flows
language: English
summary: "This is a set of flash cards to practise Kotlin flow syntax. It can be used\
  \ at regular intervals to strengthen long term memory recall of core syntax patterns\
  \ used in concurrent code with flows in Kotlin. It covers Flow basics, error handling\
  \ and testing flows. The testing section also has questions on Turbine testing library.\
  \ It does not replace the documentation at kotlinlang.org or a good book but is\
  \ a supplementary source of practice material to practise recall of the syntax and\
  \ coding patterns."
