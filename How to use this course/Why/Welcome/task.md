**Welcome to KotlinFlashKards for Flows**

This course is a set of flash cards to revise how to use flows. It does not replace the [documentation](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/flow.html) or a good book. It should be used together with other materials.

Flows are the supported way in Kotlin to do concurrency with multiple asynchronous values. It is worthwhile to know the language and library concepts to be able to fluently write code and think about problems and how they could be solved in Kotlin. These flash cards can be used to commit flow knowledge to your long term memory so that it makes it easier to read code. This helps with code comprehension because it allows you to use your long term memory to chunk code elements. Further more if you don't need to look up flow syntax every time you use it, it will help you be able to write code quickly and minimise context switches caused by researching syntax.

Each lesson in this course has a matching code snippet. Feel free to read, run and test the code. 

Running the code will reveal the nursery rhymes hidden in the flows in the output.

Letâ€™s get started with some tips on how to get the best of this course.
