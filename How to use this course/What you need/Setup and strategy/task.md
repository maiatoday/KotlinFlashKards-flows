## Setup

All the libraries are included, so you don't need anything besides this course to run the code.

## Strategy

This course is structured as a series of questions with matching code snippets with tests to illustrate the idea. To get the best results try to complete the solution from memory first before looking at the hints or using IDE autocomplete.

You could go through this entire course. An alternative is to pick lessons that interest you or that are areas that you know you have difficulties.

Memories are built up if you **repeat** the flash cards at **regular intervals**. It is better to a few lessons more often than to do many lessons in one sitting.

It is important to try to recall the syntax first before looking at the hints. This means you practise your **recall** of the memory.

For each question and answer you will remember it better too if you think of a practical place where you could use similar code.
