**What is the most important difference between coroutines and flows?**

<div class="hint">
  Coroutines can only return a single value and then they complete. If you need to work with mutiple values that are emitted over time then you need a flow. A flow is a coroutine based abstraction that provides the ability to emit multiple values asynchronously.
